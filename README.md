1. Creating an S3 Bucket: We'll set up an S3 bucket to host our static web assets, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a0f274-de27-4a4d-a706-5f30837f9b33)


2. Configuring API Gateway: You'll learn how to set up API Gateway endpoints to trigger Lambda functions. We'll cover both GET and POST methods for interacting with our DynamoDB database. [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1abff763-3a1d-4a5c-8052-8f484a0e99dc)

3. Developing Lambda Functions: We'll write Lambda functions in Python to handle requests from API Gateway. This includes functions to retrieve and insert data into DynamoDB.  [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf1b1f1-46ce-451b-818d-c0cfadefd51f)

4. Managing DynamoDB: We'll create a DynamoDB table to store our data. You'll learn how to define the table schema and perform CRUD operations using Lambda functions. [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6847ecf-e756-438c-a86c-c3025b905cbf)

5. Ensuring Secure Connections with CloudFront: To secure access to our web application, we'll deploy CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN). We'll configure CloudFront to serve our S3 content securely over HTTPS, providing encryption in transit and enhancing the performance of our application.
